# liveness-detection-streamlit
Real-Time Liveness Detection using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Streamlit

This project implements a real-time liveness detection system using a deep learning model to distinguish between real and spoofed (fake) faces. It integrates OpenCV for face detection, TensorFlow for liveness classification, and Streamlit WebRTC for real-time video streaming.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Real-time face detection and liveness classification
âœ… Uses a pre-trained deep learning model for accurate predictions
âœ… Supports live webcam input via Streamlit WebRTC
âœ… Detects spoof attacks (e.g., printed photos, videos, masks)
âœ… Lightweight and optimized for real-time performance

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:

Python
TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning Model)
OpenCV (Face Detection)
Streamlit & Streamlit-WebRTC (Web Interface & Streaming)
Easy Deployment via Streamlit
